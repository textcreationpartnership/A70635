            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Speeches of dying men are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; the Speeches of dying Chriſtians are much more remarkable; How re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable then are the Speeches of dying Witneſſes for Chriſt? It is rationally expected that dying men, much more that dying Chriſtians, and moſt of all that dying Witneſſes for Chriſt ſhould ſpeak beſt at laſt. It is their laſt.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Theſe are the laſt words of</hi> David, 2 Sam. 23.</note> And the Sun ſhineth brighteſt at ſetting. They are immediately to give in their laſt account. They are upon the borders of Eternity. And the motions of Nature are more intenſe, as they draw nearer the Center. To be ſure, Saints are moſt heavenly, when neareſt Heaven. Rivers, the nearer the Sea, the ſooner are met by the Tide. We have good Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground to expect that dying Chriſtians, eſpecially dying Witneſſes for Chriſt, ſhould have extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary aſſiſtances from on high for their laſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes: That the Wine of the Spirit ſhould be ſtrongeſt in them at their laſt. They have Gods Word for it, <hi>That in that hour it ſhall be given them,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.19.</note> what they ſhall ſpeak:</hi> for it is not they that ſpeak, but the Spirit of their Father.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:53062:4"/>
            <p> One obſerveth that when <hi>Stephen</hi> was to deliver his laſt ſpeech, and to ſuffer, he was filled with the Holy Ghoſt, ſo that all that ſate in the Council, looking ſtedfaſtly on <hi>Stephen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 6.5.</note> ſaw his face, as if it had been the face of an Angel. His ſoul was ſo warmed by the love of God, that he looked both his Adverſaries and the tempeſtuous approaching Storm our of countenance. When he was ſtoned he got a larger ſight. He ſaw the Heavens opened, and his majeſtick Glorious Maſter, the light-giving Diamond of Heaven,
<note place="margin">Act. 7.55.</note> ſtanding at his Fathers right hand. And this he got, no doubt, as for himſelf, ſo to hearten all thoſe that were to come after, he being the firſt Martyr after Chriſt. Hence it hath been often found, that their laſt Speeches have been Oraculous and Prophetical. <hi>Zenophon</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonates <hi>Cyrus</hi> as inſpired, whilſt he is breathing out his laſt requeſts.

<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 24 20, 24.</note> 
               <hi>Becauſe ye have forſaken the Lord, he hath alſo forſaken you.</hi> For this he was immediately ſtoned, and the Lord ſealed his Word very ſpeedily afterwards; <hi>For the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians coming with a ſmall company againſt them, the Lord delivered a very great multitude into their hands, and ſo without delay in their ſight ſealed the words of his dying Witneſs</hi> Zachariah. And why his word ſooner then <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s, <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s, <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s? &amp;c. By them he pleaded much longer with his Apoſtatizing Church. I know none but this: It was the Lords pleaſure; and to ſhew his reſpect to dying Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that he would have what they ſay taken
<pb facs="tcp:53062:4"/>ſpecial notice of. It may be, that he might ſhew, that whatever fail, the words of dying Witneſſes ſhall not fall to the ground. It is true, we muſt not lay ſuch weight upon theſe ſayings,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9</note> as we muſt lay upon Scripture propheſies; for though ſuch ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings may be true propheſies, yet we are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly aſſured that theſe are propheſies, till they be accompliſhed: yet their ſayings, while dying for and in the Lord, do give good encouragement to them that remain alive, and ſo to be much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed by them; whether they reſpect the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, or the good of ſouls.</p>
            <p>The laſt Speeches of Chriſts dying Witneſſes, have extorted even from Heathens acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the honour of God,
<note place="margin">Vere ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnus eſt Deus Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum Caloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</note> that truly the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans God is a great God: yea, by them ſinners have been converted. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and others by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the end the Martyrs made, were brought out of love with the wayes of ſin, and in love with the wayes of holineſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe Speeches (here collected) are called <hi>Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Songs,</hi> for their remarkableneſs, <hi>A Cloud of Witneſſes,</hi> and <hi>The Sufferers Mirrour</hi> for their uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.

<pb facs="tcp:53062:5"/>death. How can the beſt of us read theſe paſſages, without ſhame for our low attainments, for our little proficiency in the School of Chriſt? How unlike are our faces to the faces in this Mirrour? How ſelf-denying were they? How ſelfiſh are we? How crucified to the world were they? How much glued thereunto are we? How eaſie was it for them to chuſe the greateſt Sufferings, rather then the leaſt Sin? How hard is it for us not to chuſe the greateſt Sin, rather then the leaſt Suffering? How willing were they to part with all for Chriſt? How unwilling are we to part with littles for Chriſt? What an honour did they eſteem it to ſuffer for Chriſt, to be chain'd, to be whipt, to be wrackt, to be halter'd, to be ſtak'd for Chriſt? Have we ſuch eſteems of ſufferings for Chriſt, and of ſuch ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Are not we aſhamed of our glory? How pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient were they under the greateſt tortures? How impatient are we under very little troubles? How hot was their love to Chriſt, his truths, ordinances, People? How cold is ours? How zealous were they for the honour of God? How luke-warm are we? How magnanimous were they? How cowardly and daſtardly are we? How humble were they? How proud are we? How broken-hearted were they? How hard-hearted are we? What ſympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing ſpirits had they? How little fellow-feeling is there now among Chriſtians? How active were they for the glory of God, and good of ſouls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ſufferings? how ſlothful are we? And how little do we for either under our ſufferings? How ſtrong was their Faith? How weak is ours? How fearleſs were they of man, who can only kill the body? How fearful are we? How many of theſe Worthies attained unto Aſſurance, and had their
<pb facs="tcp:53062:5"/>Evidences for Heaven clear? How are the moſt of us in the dark, as to an intereſt in God, and a right and title to Glory? How willing and desirous were they to die, even a violent death? How loth are we to die, even a natural death? How did they without the leaſt fear play on the hole of this Aſp, and with much courage put their hand into the Den of this Cockatrice? But how doth the fear of this King of Terrors make us ſubject to bondage? Thus they are uſeful to ſhame us: They are alſo uſeful to prepare us to die, eſpecially a violent death. Such examples chalk the way more plainly,

               </note> then bare direction: Theſe encourage more hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily: theſe perſwade more powerfully: theſe chide unbelief with more authority. I beſeech you all, who are the Lords people, (ſaid one lately) not to ſcare at ſuffering for the intereſts of Chriſt; becauſe of any thing you may ſee fall out in theſe dayes; as to the ſufferings of his ſervants: but be encouraged to do and ſuffer; for I aſſure you, in the Name of the Lord, he will bear all your charges. I do again aſſure you, in his <hi>Name,</hi> he will furniſh all your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and bear all your charges.

            <p>THe life preſent is onely preparative to that to come, as the <hi>hidden</hi> life in the <hi>womb</hi> to the more <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>noble</hi> life in the <hi>world,</hi> 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 12. Salvation is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneous. The Heirs of Glory make their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual approaches to it, and enter upon their Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance by degrees, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11. And the neares they come to <hi>Heaven,</hi> the more heavenly their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are, Could a man but hear the laſt breathings and whiſpers of dying Saints, how would he melt and raviſh? Like the Sun they appear moſt great and glorious at ſetting. God often leads them to the top of <hi>Piſgah,</hi> whence they have a proſpect of <hi>Canaan,</hi> a little before they enter in to poſſeſs it.</p>
            <p>But although God doth frequently indulge thoſe that die <hi>in the Faith</hi> of Chriſt with rare and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent viſions of Chriſt, yet ordinarily thoſe that die <hi>for Chriſt</hi> as well as in Chriſt, have a <hi>Benjamin</hi>'s portion in compariſon of their Brethren. There is a joy proper to Martyrs, which is beſtowed upon them as an <hi>honorarium,</hi> partly to <hi>reward</hi> their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in trials <hi>paſt;</hi> and partly to <hi>encourage</hi> them to break through the difficulties which yet remain.</p>
            <p>In theſe joys Heaven is let down to Earth, glory antedated, and a ſhort ſalvation here obtained, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. During the continuance of this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous frame, they are acted above the ordinary rate
<pb facs="tcp:53062:7"/>of man, which makes the world ſtand at gize, and all that behold them to admire at them. Their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is rather <hi>angelical</hi> then <hi>humane, Acts</hi> 6.15. and they ſeem no longer fit to be <hi>reckoned</hi> to the Tribe of mortals on Earth, but rather <hi>ranked</hi> with the glorious Saints and Seraphims in Heaven; they no longer wrap themſelves up in their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fleſh, but the onely ſtrife among them ſeems to be who ſhall firſt caſt it off, to put on the garments of glory prepared for them.</p>
            <p>Reader, wouldſt thou ſee ſome of theſe <hi>Earthly Angels?</hi> men that are a little <hi>too low</hi> for <hi>Heaven,</hi> and much <hi>too high</hi> for <hi>Earth.</hi> Wouldſt thou ſee poor frail Creatures trampling the World under their feet, and with an holy ſcorn ſmiling at the threats of <hi>Tyrants,</hi> who are the terrors of the mighty in the Land of the Living? Wouldſt thou ſee ſhack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Priſoners</hi> behave themſelves like <hi>Judges;</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> ſtand like <hi>Priſoners</hi> before them? Wouldſt thou ſee ſome of the rare <hi>exploits</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> in its higheſt elevation immediatly before it be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the beatifical viſion? To conclude, Wouldſt thou ſee the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> pourtraied on Earth, as the earthly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> once was upon a Tile, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.1. And wouldſt thou hear the melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious voices of aſcending Saints, in a raviſhing conſort, ready to joyn with the heavenly <hi>Chorus,</hi> in their raviſhing Hallelujahs? Then draw near; come and ſee. If thou be a man of an heavenly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, here is brave &amp; ſuitable entertainment for thy ſpirit. And after thou haſt converſed a while with theſe excellent Spirits, it may be thou wilt judge as I do, That dead Saints are ſweeter Companions (in ſome reſpects) for thee to converſe with, then thoſe that are living. And when thou ſhalt ſee the <hi>magnificent</hi> acts of their Faith, their invincible <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>

In the place of ſorrow and death, tranquility of hope and life: when others do weep, I do rejoyce; when others do ſhake and tremble, there I have found plenty of ſtrength and boldneſs: in ſtrait bands, and cold irons I have had reſt: Behold he that was once far from me, now is preſent with me; whom once I could ſcarce feel, I now ſee moſt apparently; whom once I ſaw afar off, now I behold near at hand, whom once I hungred for, the ſame now approacheth and reacheth his hand unto me; he doth comfort me, and heapeth me up with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he driveth away all bitterneſs; he mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth ſtrength and courage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—O how eaſie and ſweet is the Lords yoke! Learn, ye well-belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, how amiable the Lord is, how meek, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, who viſiteth his ſervants in temptations; neither diſdaineth he to keep company with us in ſuch vile and ſtinking Caves. Will the blind and incredulous world (think you) believe this? or rather will it not ſay thus? No, thou wilt never be able to abide long the burning heat, the pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardneſs of that place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The rebukes and frowning faces of great men how wilt thou ſuffer? Doſt not thou conſider thy pleaſant Countrey, the Riches of the World, thy Kinsfolk, the delicate pleaſures and Honours of this life? Doſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the ſolace of thy Sciences, and fruit of all thy Labours? Wilt thou thus loſe all thy labours, which thou haſt hitherto ſuſtained? Finally, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou not death which hangeth over thee? O what a fool art thou, which for one words ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mayeſt ſalve all this and wilt not! But now to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53062:10"/>anſwer: Let this blind world hearken to this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, What heat can there be more burning, then that fire which is prepared for thee hereafter? What things more hard, and ſharp, and crooked than this preſent life which we lead? What thing more odious and hateful than this world here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? And let theſe worldly men here anſwer me. What Countrey can we have more ſweet than the Heavenly Countrey above? What treaſures more rich or precious than everlaſting life? and who be our Kinſmen but they which hear the Word of God? Where be greater riches or dignities more honourable than in Heaven? And as touching the Sciences, let this fooliſh world conſider, Be not they ordained to know God? whom unleſs we do know, all our labours, our night-watchings, our ſtudies, and all our enterpriſes here ſerve to no purpoſe, all is but labour loſt. Furthermore let the miſerable worldly men anſwer me. What remedy or ſafe refuge can there be unto him who lacks God, who is the life &amp; medicine of all men, &amp; how can he be ſaid to fly from death, when he himſelf is already dead in ſin? If Chriſt be the way, verity &amp; life, how can there be any life without Chriſt? The ſolely heat of the Priſon to me is coldneſs; the cold winter to me is a freſh ſpring in the Lord. He that feareth not to be burned in the fire, how will he fear the heat of weather? Or what careth he for the pinching froſt, which burneth for the love of the Lord? The place is ſharp and tedious to them that be guilty, but to the innocent it is mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifluous. Here droppeth the delectable dew, here floweth the pleaſant <hi>Nectar;</hi> here runneth the ſweet milk, here is plenty of all good things.—In this world there is no manſion firm to me, and therefore I will travel up to the New <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53062:11"/>which is in Heaven, and which offereth it ſelf to me without paying any Fine or Income.—I have travelled hitherto, laboured, and ſweat early and late, watching day and night, and now my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels begin to come to effect.—What man can now cavil, that theſe our labours are loſt, which have followed and found out the Lord and Maker of the World, and which have changed death with life?—If to dye in the Lord be not to dye, but to live moſt joyfully, where is this wretched worldly Rebel, which blameth us of folly, for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving away our lives unto death? O how delectable is this death to me! to taſte of the Lords Cup.—I am accuſed of fooliſhneſs, for that I do not rid my ſelf out of theſe troubles, when with one word I may. But doth not Chriſt ſay, <hi>Fear not them which kill the body, but him which killeth both body and ſoul; and whoſoever ſhall confeſs me before men, him will I alſo confeſs before my Father which is in Heaven; and he that denyeth me before men, him will Falſo deny before my Heavenly Father.</hi> Seeing the words of the Lord be ſo plain, how, or by what authority will this wiſe Counſellor approve this his counſel which he doth give? God forbid that I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh the commandements of God, and follow the counſels of men; for it is written, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that hath not gone in the way of ſinners, and hath not ſtood in the counſel of the ungodly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.1. God forbid I ſhould deny Chriſt, where I ought to confeſs him; I will not ſet more by my life, then by my ſoul; neither will I exchange the life to come for this world here preſent.—</p>

And I do believe that this his Death and Paſſion was the Iufficient Price and Ranſom for the ſin of all the World; And I do believe that through his Death he overcame the Devil, Sin, Death, and Hell, and that there is none other ſatisfaction unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but this his Death and Paſſion onely; and that no work of man did deſerve any thing of God, but onely his Paſſion, as touching our juſtification; for I acknowledge the beſt work that ever I did is impure and unperfect. (Herewithal he caſt abroad his Arms, and deſired God to forgive him his Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes) Wherefore I truſt in no good work that ever I did, but onely in the Death of Chriſt, and I do not doubt but through him to inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.—The Sheriff haſtening him to make an end, he turned to the people and deſired all men to forgive him, and if he had ſaid any evil at any time unadviſedly, whereby he had offended any man, or given any occaſion of evil, that they would forgive it him, &amp; amend that evil they took of him, and to bear witneſs, that he deteſted and abhorred all evil Opinions and Doctrines againſt the Word of God, &amp; that he died in the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, by whom he doubted not to be ſaved.</p>

Now thought I, if I ſhall withdraw my ſelf, and make any ſhifts to pull my own neck out of the Coller, I ſhall give great offence to my weak Brethren in Chriſt, and advantage to the enemies to ſlander Gods Word. It will be ſaid, he hath been a great emboldner of others to be earneſt and fervent, to fear no worldly perils and dangers, but he himſelf will give no ſuch example. Wherefore I thought it my bounden duty both to God and man, being (as it were) by the great goodneſs of God called and appointed hereunto, to ſetaſide all fear, perils and dangers, all worldly reſpects and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and like as I had before, according to the meaſure of my ſmall gift, within the compaſs of my vocation and calling, from the bottom of my heart unſeignedly moved exhorted, and perſwaded all that profeſs Gods Word, manfully to perſiſt in the defence of the ſame, not with ſword and violence, but with ſuffering and loſs of life, rather than to defile themſelves again with the whoriſh abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Romiſh Antichriſt. So the hour being come with my fact &amp; example to ratifie, confirm, and proteſt the ſame to the hearts of all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and to this end (by the mighty aſſiſtance of Gods holy Spirit) I reſolved my ſelf with much peace of conſcience, willingly to ſuſtain whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Romiſh Antichriſt ſhould do againſt me.

He departed from me, ſaying I needed not to fear if I would be of his belief.

If you will rob us &amp; ſpoil us for doing the Lords will, to the Lord muſt you make anſwer, and not to us; for his goods they are, and not ours. If ye will impriſon us, behold you are oppreſſours; if ye will hang us, or burn us, behold ye are mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of them which fear the Lord.—And for our part, if you take from us this vile and corrupri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life, we are ſure the Lord will grant it us again with joy, and immortality, both of ſoul and body.

                  <p>The Sheriff asking him, who he was, from whence he came, and for what he came thither; I am come (ſaid he) to publiſh, that I ſet nothing by your deſires againſt the Chriſtian Religion, but that I profeſs Jeſus Chriſt to be my hope and ſafety.</p>

Charity doth not decay, but increaſe in them that die faithfully. — If thy Friend be out of ſight, is thy friendſhip ended? —If he be carried into Heaven, is Charity hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thereby? The Fathers of the Primitive Church gave thanks for their Friends that died in the Faith, to prove that Charity died not with Death.—What ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, We are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his blood; we are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one of another.</hi> Is the hand or Arm, Foot or Leg, a member, when it is diſſevered from the body? What is it that couples us, but love? When all things ſhall fail, love faileth never. Hope hath his end, when we get that we hoped for. Faith is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in Heaven. Love endureth for ever: Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual love, I mean; for carnal love, when that which we love is loſt, doth periſh with the fleſh. Neither was that ever but fleſhly love, which by diſtance of place or ſevering of bodies, is parted aſunder.—If we keep Chriſts commandment in loving each other, as he loved us, then ſhould our love be everlaſting. This friendſhip <hi>Paul</hi> felt, when it moved him to ſay, <hi>That neither length nor breadth, neither height nor depth, ſhould ſever him from the love of Chriſt.</hi> Now you may ſay, Why writeth
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53062:81"/>thou this? Truly to the end, that if our friendſhip be ſtable, you may accompliſh this the laſt requeſt of your Friend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—Mr. <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> I beſeech you remember <hi>Wittrance</hi> and <hi>Cook,</hi> two ſingular men among common Priſoners.

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (as though they onely had been there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meet) appointed onely Widows to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the Saints, and to gather for the poor.— Alas!

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53062:82"/>not relieved; ſick, and not viſitted; impriſoned, and not ſeen. In times paſt men could beſtow large ſums of money on Copes, Veſtments, and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church: why rather follow we not St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his example, who ſold the ſame for the relief of the poor; or <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s command, who willed firſt to deck and garniſh the living Temple of God? But alas! ſuch is the wickedneſs of theſe our laſt dayes, that nothing moves us, neither the pure Doctrine, the godlineſs of life, nor good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Ancient Fathers. If in any thing they erred, that will their charitable children em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, publiſh and maintain with ſword, faggot and fire: but all in vain they ſtrive againſt the ſtream; for though in deſpite of the Truth, by force of the ears of crafty perſwaſion, they may bring themſelves into the haven of Hell; yet can they not make all men believe that the banks move while the ſhip ſaileth, nor ever ſhall be able to turn the direct courſe of the ſtream of Gods Truth.—</p>

What is then (ſaid he) required of a Chriſtian? To believe (ſaid ſhe) in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, three Perſons and one God. What (ſaid he) is there nothing elſe required or looked for in a Chriſtian, but to believe in him?
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 32.</note> Yes (ſaid ſhe) We muſt love him with all our heart, with all our ſoul, and with all our mind, and our Neighbour as our ſelf. Why then (ſaid he) faith juſtifies not, and ſaveth not.

Faith and love go both together, and yet love is comprehended in faith. How muſt we love our Neighbour? (ſaid he) To love our Neighbour (ſaid ſhe) is to feed the hungry, to cloath the naked, and give drink to the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and to do to him as we would do to our ſelves. Why then (ſaid he) it is neceſſary unto ſalvation to do good works alſo, and it is not ſufficient onely to believe. It is meet (ſaid ſhe) that a Chriſtian in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that he follows his Maſter Chriſt to do good works, yet may we not ſay, that they profit to our ſalvation; for when we have done all, we be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervants, and faith onely in Chriſts blood ſaveth us. How many Sacraments are there? (ſaid he) Two (ſaid ſhe) The one the Sacrament of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, by which I am waſhed with water, &amp; rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by the Spirit, &amp; that waſhing is a token to me that I am a child of God: the other the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, which offered to me is a ſure ſeal and teſtimony that I am by the blood of Chriſt, which he ſhed for me on the Croſs, made partaker of the everlaſting Kingdome. There are ſeven (ſaid he) By what Scripture (ſaid ſhe) find you that. Well (ſaid he) we will talk of that hereafter. What do you receive in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper? Do you not receive the very body and blood of Chriſt? No ſurely (ſaid ſhe) I believe that the Supper I neither receive fleſh nor blood, but Bread and Wine, which Bread, when it is broken, and Wine, when it is drunken, putteth me in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, how that for my ſins, the Body of Chriſt was broken, &amp; his Blood ſhed on the Croſs,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53062:84"/>and with that Bread and Wine I receive the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that come by the breaking of his Body, &amp; ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his Blood for our ſins on the Croſs. Why (ſaid he) doth not Chriſt ſpeak theſe words, <hi>Take, eat, this is my Body?</hi> Require you any plainer words? Doth he not ſay it is his Body?

                  <p>The night before ſhe ſuffered, ſhe ſent unto her Siſter, the Lady <hi>Katharine</hi> the New Teſtament in <hi>Greek,</hi> at the end whereof ſhe wrote thus.</p>
                  <p>I have ſent you (good Siſter) a Book, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not outwardly trimmed with Gold, yet inwardly it is more worth than precious ſtones. It is the Book of the Law of the Lord. It is his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament and laſt Will which he bequeathed unto us wretches, which ſhall lead you to the path of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal joy; and if you with a good mind read it, and with an earneſt mind do purpoſe to follow it, it ſhall bring you to an immortal &amp; everlaſting life. It ſhall teach you to live, and learn you to die. It ſhall win you more than you ſhould have gained by the poſſeſſion of your woful Fathers lands; for, as if God had proſpered him, you ſhould have inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his lands: ſo if you ply diligently this Book, ſeeking to direct your life after it, you ſhall be an inheriter of ſuch riches, as neither the covetous ſhall withdraw from you, nor the thief ſteal, nor the moth corrupt. Deſire with <hi>David</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53062:88"/>the Law of the Lord God. Live ſtill to die, that you by death may purchaſe eternal life. Truſt not that the tenderneſs of your age ſhall lengthen your life: the young die (if God call) aſſoon as the old. Labour alwayes to learn to die, defie the world, deny the Devil, and deſpiſe the fleſh, and delight your ſelf onely in the Lord. Be penitent for your ſins, but yet deſpair not; be ſtrong in faith, and yet preſume not. Deſire with St. <hi>Paul to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt,</hi> with whom, even in death, there is life. Be like the good Servant, and even at mid-night be waking, leaſt when death cometh, and ſtealeth upon you, as a thief in the night, you be with the evil Servant found ſleeping, and leaſt for lack of oyl ye be found like the fooliſh women, and like him that had not on the Wedding Garment, and then ye be caſt out from the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Rejoyce in Chriſt, as I do. Follow the ſteps of your Maſter Chriſt, and take up your Croſs. Lay your ſins on his back, and alwayes embrace him. And as concerning my death, rejoyce as I do, that I ſhall be delivered of this corruption, and put on incorruption; for I am aſſured, that I ſhall for looſing of a mortal life, win an immortal life, the which I pray God grant you, and ſend you of his grace to live in his fear, and to die in the true Chriſtian Faith, from the which (in Gods Name) I exhort you that you never ſwarve, neither for hope of life, nor fear of death; for if you will deny his truth for to lengthen your life, God will deny you, and yet ſhorten your dayes. And if you will cleave unto him, he will prolong your dayes to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and his glory; to the which glory God bring me now, and you hereafter, when it ſhall pleaſe him to call you. Fare you well (good Siſter) and

                  <p>In her Speech upon the Scaffold.—Good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I am come hither to die, and by a Law I am condemned to the ſame.

I pray you bear me witneſs, that I die a true Chriſtian, and that I look to be ſaved by no other mean, but onely by the mercy of God in the blood of his onely Son Jeſus Chriſt. I confeſs, when I did know the Word of God, I neglected the ſame, loved my ſelf and the world, and therefore this plague is worthily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to me for my ſins; and yet I thank God of his goodneſs, that he hath thus given me a time and reſpite to repent; and now, good people, while I am alive, I pray you aſſiſt me with your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.—</p>
                  <p>In her Prayer.—Thou, O Lord, art the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Defender and Deliverer of thoſe that put their truſt in thee; and therefore I being defiled with ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> overwhelmed with miſeries, vexed with temptations, and grievouſly tormented. With the long impriſonment of this vile maſs of clay, my ſinful body, doth come unto thee (O merciful Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) craving thy mercy and help, who haſt ſaid, Thou wilt not ſuffer us to be tempted above our power.—O merciful God, conſider my miſery beſt known unto thee, &amp; be thou unto me a ſtrong Tower of defence. Suffer me not to be tempted above my power, but either be thou a Deliverer to me out of this great miſery, or elſe give me grace patiently to bear thy heavy hand and ſharp corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

How long wilt thou be abſent? for ever? O Lord, haſt thou forgotten to be gracious, and ſhut up thy loving kindneſs in diſpleaſure? Wilt thou be no more entreated? Is thy mercy clean gone for ever, and thy promiſe come utterly to an end for evermore? Why doſt thou make ſo long tarrying? Shall I deſpair of thy mercy O God? far be that from me.

Of gladneſs in this, that I perceived how ye be bent and given to prayer and invocation of Gods help in theſe dark and wicked proceedings of men againſt Gods glory. I have been ſorry to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the malice and wickedneſs of men to be ſo cruel, devilliſh, and tyranical to perſecute the people of God for ſerving of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe cruel doings do declare, that the Papiſts Church is more bloody and tyrannical, than ever was the ſword of the Ethnicks and Gentiles. — <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour commanded, That no man ſhould be perſecuted for ſerving of God: but the Pope and his Church have caſt you into Priſon, being taken doing the Work of God, and one of the excellenteſt Works, that is required of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>viz.</hi> whileſt ye were in Prayer. — O glad may ye be that ever ye were born to be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whileſt ye were ſo vertuouſly occupied. <hi>Bleſsed be they that ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake.</hi> If God had

But the Lord would not have you ſuddenly ſo to depart, but reſerveth you gloriouſly to ſpeak and maintain his Truth to the world. Be ye not careful what ye ſhall ſay; for God will go out and in with you, and will be preſent in your hearts and in your mouths to ſpeak his wiſedome, though it ſeems fooliſhneſs to the world. He that hath begun this good work in you, continue in the ſame unto the end. Pray unto him,

Your Cauſe is moſt juſt and godly, ye ſtand for the true Chriſt (who is after the fleſh in Heaven) and for his true Religion and Honour, which is amply, fully, ſufficiently, and abundantly contained in the holy Teſtament, ſealed with Chriſts own blood.

Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what <hi>lookers on</hi> you have to lee and behold you in your fight, God and all his holy Angels; who be ready alwayes to take you up into Heaven, if ye be flain in his fight.

<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.</note> for he that is in you, is ſtronger than he that is in them. Shrink not although it be pain to you: your pains be not now ſo great, as hereafter your joyes ſhall be. Read the Comfortable Chapters to the <hi>Romans,</hi> 8.10, 15. <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11.12. And upon your knees thank God that ever ye were accounted worthy to ſuffer any thing for his Names ſake. Read the ſecond Chapter of <hi>Luke,</hi> and there you ſhall ſee how the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds that watched their Sheep all night, as ſoon as they heard that Chriſt was born at <hi>Bethelem,</hi> by and by went to ſee him. They did not reaſon not debate with themſelves who ſhould keep the Wolf from the Sheep in the mean time, but did as they were commanded, and committed their Sheep unto him, whoſe pleaſure they obeyed. So let us do now we be called, commit all other things to him that calleth us. He will take heed that all things ſhall be well. He will help the Husband, he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Wife: he will guide the Servants: he will keep the Houſe: he will preſerve the Goods; yea rather then it ſhould be undone, he wil waſh the Diſhes and rock the Cradle. Caſt therefore all your care upon God; for he careth for you. Beſides this, you may perceive by your impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that your Adverſaries weapons againſt you be nothing but fleſh, and blood, and tyranny, for if they were able, they would maintain their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by Gods Word; but for lack of that, they would violently compel, ſuch as they cannot by holy Scripture perſwade; becauſe the holy Word of God, and all Chriſts doings be contrary unto them. Ipray you pray for me, and I will pray for you.</p>

                        <p> Now is the time of trial, to ſee whether we fear more, God or man. It was an eaſie thing to hold with Chriſt, whilſt the Prince and world held with him; but now the world hateth him, it is the true trial who be his. Wherefore in the Name, and in the Vertue, Strength, and Power of his holy Spirit, prepare your ſelves in any caſe to adverſity and conſtancy. Let us not run away when it is moſt time to fight. Remember none ſhall be crowned, but ſuch as fight manfully; and he that endureth to the end ſhall be ſaved. Ye muſt now turn all your cogitations from the peril you ſee, and mark the felicity that followeth the peril, either victory in this world of your enemies, or elſe a ſurrender of this life to inherit the everlaſting Kingdome. Beware of beholding too much the felicity, or miſery of this world; for the conſideration and too earneſt or love fear of either of them draweth from God. Wherefore think with your ſelves, as touching the felicity of the world, it is good; but yet none otherwiſe than it ſtandeth with the favor of God. It is to be kept; but yet ſo far forth, as by keeping of it we loſe not God.

There is nothing under God, but may be kept, ſo that God, being above all things we have, be not loſt. Of adverſity judge the ſame. Impriſonment is painful, but yet liberty upon evil conditions is more painful. The Priſons ſtink; but yet not ſo much as ſweet Houſes, where the fear and true honour of God is lacking. I muſt be alone and ſolitary: It is better to be ſo, and have God with me, then to be in company with
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53062:115"/>the wicked. Loſs of Goods is great; but loſs of Gods grace and favour is greater. I am a poor ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple creature, and cannot tell how to anſwer before ſuch a great ſort of noble, learned, and wiſe men: It is better to make anſwer before the pomp and pride of wicked men, than to ſtand naked in the fight of all Heaven and Earth before the juſt God at the later day. I ſhall die then by the hands of the cruel man: He is bleſſed, that loſeth his life full of miſeries, and findeth the life of eternal joyes. It is pain and grief to depart from Goods and Friends; but yet not ſo much as to depart from grace and heaven it ſelf.

                           <pb n="224" facs="tcp:53062:120"/>—For your liberality I moſt heartily thank you, and praiſe God highly in you for you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> praying him to preſerve you from all famine, ſcarcity, and lack of the truth of his Word, which is the lively food of your ſouls, as you preſerve my body from hunger and other neceſſaries which would happen unto me, were it not cared for by the charity of godly people. Such as have ſpoiled me of all that I had, have impriſoned me, and appointed not one half-penny to feed or relieve me withall; but I do forgive them, and pray for them daily in my poor Prayer to God, and from my heart I wiſh their ſalvation, and quietly and patiently bear their injuries, wiſhing no farther extremity to be uſed towards us: yet if the contrary ſeem beſt to our heavenly Father, I have made my reckoning, and fully reſolved to ſuffer the uttermoſt that they are able to do againſt me; yea death it ſelf by the aid of Chriſt Jeſus, who died the moſt vile death of the Croſs for us, wretched and miſerable ſinners. But of this I am aſſured, that the wicked world with all his force and power ſhall not touch one of the hairs of our heads without leave and licenſe of our heavenly Father, whoſe will be done in all things. If he will life, life be it; if he will death, death be it; only we pray that our wills may be ſubject to his will. — If we be contented to obey Gods will, and for his commands ſake to ſurrender our goods and our lives to be at his pleaſure, it maketh no matter whether we keep goods and life, or loſe them. Nothing can hurt us that is taken from us for Gods cauſe, nor can any thing at length do us good that is preſerved contrary to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Let us wholly ſuffer God to uſe us and ours after his holy wiſdome, and beware we neither uſe nor govern our ſelves contrary to his will by
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53062:120"/>our own wiſdome; for if we do, our wiſdome will at length prove fooliſhneſs. It is kept to no good purpoſe, that we keep contrary to his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It can by no means be taken from us, that he would ſhould tarry with us. He is no good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that ruleth himſelf and his, as worldly means ſerve; for he that ſo doth, ſhall have as many changes as chances in the world. To day with the world he ſhall live and praiſe the truth of God, to morrow, as the world will, ſo will he like and praiſe the falſhood of man; to day with Chriſt, to morrow with Antichriſt. — Glorifie your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father both with your inward and outward man. If ye think ye can inwardly in the heart ſerve him, and yet outwardly ſerve with the world in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſervice the thing that is not of God, ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your ſelves; for both the body and ſoul muſt concur together in the honour of God;

Therefore (dear Brethren) pray to the heavenly Father, that as he ſpared not the ſoul nor the body of his dearly beloved Son, but applied both of them with extream pain, to work our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of ſoul and body: ſo he will give us all grace to apply our ſouls and bodies to be Servants to him. — Let us not deride our ſelves, and ſay our ſouls ſerve him, whatſoever bodies do to the contrary for civil order and policy.

Judge not my Brother truth by outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for truth now worſe appeareth, and is more vilely rejected then falſhood. Leave the outward ſhew, and ſee by the Word of God what is truth, and accept truth, and diſlike her not, though man call her falſhood. As it is now, ſo it hath been
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53062:121"/>heretofore: truth hath been rejected, and falſhood received. Such as have profeſſed truth, have ſmarted, and the friends of falſhood laughed them to ſcorn. The one having the commendation of truth by man, but the condemnation of falſhood by God, flouriſhing for a time with endleſs deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the other afflicted a little ſeaſon, but ending with immortal joyes. Wherefore, dear Brother, ask and demand of your Book, the Teſtament of Jeſus Chriſt, in theſe woful and wretched dayes, what you ſhould think, and what you ſhould ſtay your ſelves upon for a certain truth, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you hear taught, try it by your Book, whether it be true or falſe.

                  <p>In his Letter to his Benefactors.—I exhort you by the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt, that now ye ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide the vanities of this preſent world, will give your ſervice to the eternal King Chriſt the Lord. Truſt not in Princes, nor in the Sons of men, in whom there is no health; for the Sons of men are diſſemblers and deceitful. To day they are, to morrow they periſh; but God remaineth for ever. He hath his Servants not for any need he hath of them, but for their own profit, unto whom he performeth that which he promiſeth, and fulfilleth that which he purpoſeth to give. He caſteth off no faithful Servant from him; for he ſaith, <hi>Where I am, there alſo ſhall my Servant be;</hi> yea, the Lord maketh every Servant of his to be the Lord of all his poſſeſſion, giving himſelf unto him, and with himſelf all things.—O happy is that Servant, whom when the Lord ſhall come, he ſhall find watching. Happy is the Servant which ſhall receive that King of Glory with joy. Wherefore well beloved Lords and Benefactors, ſerve you that King in fear.—</p>
                  <p>In his Letter to the Lord <hi>John de Clum.</hi>—The iniquity of the great <hi>Strumpet, i.e.</hi> of the malignant Congregation (whereof mention is made in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi>) is detected, and ſhall be more detected; with the which <hi>Strumpet</hi> the Kings of the Earth do commit fornication, fornicating ſpiritually from Chriſt; and as is there ſaid, ſliding back from the truth, and conſenting to the lies of Antichriſt; through his ſeduction, and through fear, or through hope of confederacy, forgetting of worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53062:133"/>—I rejoyced to perceive your mind now to give over the vanity and painful ſervice of this preſent world, and to ſerve the Lord Jeſus Chriſt quietly at home, whom to ſerve is to reign, as <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> ſaith, whom he that ſerveth faithfully hath Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt himſelf in the Kingdome of Heaven to miniſter unto him, as himſelf ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is that Servant, whom when the Lord ſhall come he ſhall find waking, and ſo doing. Verily I ſay unto you, that he ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſhall gird himſelf, and ſhall miniſter unto him.</hi> This do not the Kings of the world to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. —</p>
                  <p>In another Letter.— As touching death, God doth know why he doth defer it both to me and to my well beloved Brother Mr. <hi>Jerome,</hi> who I truſt will do holily and without blame, and do know alſo that now he ſuffereth more valiantly then I my ſelf a wretched ſinner. God hath given us a long time that we may call to mind our ſins the better, and repent for the ſame more fervently. He hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us time, that our long and great temptation ſhould put away our grievous ſins, and bring the more conſolation. He hath given us time, wherein we ſhould remember the horrible rebukes of our merciful King and Lord Jeſus, and ſhould ponder his cruel death, and ſo more patiently may learn to bear our afflictions. And moreover, that we might keep in remembrance how the joyes of the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They were about to ſhake my conſtancy from the verity of Chriſt, but they could not overcome the vertue of God in me. They would not reaſon with the Scriptures againſt me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when I ſaid I was deſirous to be inſtructed, if I did in any thing erre, the chief Cardinal anſwered, Becauſe thou wouldſt be informed, there is no remedy but that thou muſt firſt revoke thy Doctrine, according to the determination of fifty Batchelors appointed. O high inſtruction!</p>

                  <p> —Theſe things I thought good to write unto you, that you may know how they have overcome with no grounded Scripture, nor with reaſon, but onely did eſſay with terrours and deceits to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me to revoke and to abjure.

                  <p>In another Letter.—Beloved, I thought it needful to warn, that you ſhould not be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, becauſe the Adverſaries have decreed that my Books ſhall be burnt. Remember how the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> burned the Preachings of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and yet they could not avoid the things that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of in them;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pa.</hi> 826.</note> for after they were burnt, the Lord commanded to write the ſame Propheſie again, and that larger; which was done.—It is alſo written in the Books of the <hi>Macabees,</hi> that the wicked did burn the Law of God, and killed them that had the ſame. Again, under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they burned the Saints with the Books of the Law of God.—Remember the ſayings of our merciful Saviour, by which he forewarneth us; <hi>There ſhall be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>before the Day of Judgement great tribulation,

                  <p>—The Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> ſhall not extend to <hi>Bobemia;</hi> for I think that many of them which are of the Council ſhall die before they ſhall get from you my Books. They ſhall depart from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and be ſcattered abroad throughout all parts of the world, like Storks, and then they ſhall know when Winter cometh what they did in Summer.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53062:134"/>I truſt in God that he will ſend after me thoſe that ſhall be more valiant; and there are alive at this day that ſhall make more manifeſt the malice of Antichriſt, and ſhall give their lives to the death for the truth of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall give both to you and me the joyes of life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—This Epiſtle was written upon St. <hi>John Baptiſt's</hi> day in Priſon and in cold Irons, I having this Meditation with my ſelf, that <hi>John</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed in his Priſon and Bonds for the Word of God.</p>

Pray to the Lord, for the ſpirit is ready, but the fleſh is weak.—Know this for certain, that I have had
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53062:135"/>great conflicts by dreams, in ſuch ſort as I had much ado to refrain from crying out. I dreamed of the Popes eſcape before he went; and after the Lord <hi>John</hi> had told me thereof, immediately in the night it was told me, that the Pope ſhould return to you again. I dreamed alſo of the apprehending Mr. <hi>Hierom,</hi> although not in full manner as it was done. All the impriſonments, whither and how I am carried, were opened to me before, although not fully after the ſame form and circumſtance. Many Serpents oftentimes appeared to me, having heads alſo in their tail; but none of them could bite me. Theſe things I write, not eſteeming my ſelf a Prophet, or that I extol my ſelf, but onely to ſignifie to you what temptations I had in body and alſo in mind, and what great fear I had, leſt I ſhould tranſgreſs the Commandments of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.—</p>
                  <p>In a Letter to the Lord <hi>John de Clum.</hi>—I pray you expound to me the dream of this night. I ſaw how that in my Church of <hi>Bethlem</hi> they came to raze all the Images of Chriſt, and did put them out. The next day after I aroſe and ſaw many Painters which made more fairer Images, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more then I had done before, which thing I was very glad and joyful to behold. And the Painters with much people about them, ſaid, Let the Biſhops and Prieſts come now, and put out theſe Pictures.
